# ProjectTwo

### There are a few things to do in order to successfully run this application (for now).

1) After cloning the repo, make sure to run npm install to be up to date with the projects dependencies.
2) Run MAMP, then connect to port 3306 in MySQL Workbench.
3) Create SQL Script with the following code

      ```DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS medApp;```
      
      ```CREATE DATABASE medApp;```
      
4) Run node server.js in bash (or nodemon if you prefer)
5) The application should be available via ```localhost:8080```
6) Create an account and test it out!
